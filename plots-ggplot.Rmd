# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```

```{r}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))
ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))
gg_base <- ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors))

gg_base + geom_line(color = "purple",linetype = "dashed")
# gg_base + geom_point(color = "purple", pch = 17, size = 4, alpha = 0.5)
gg_base + geom_point(aes(size = visitors, color = visitors),alpha = 0.5)
# gg_base + geom_col()
gg_base + geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
gg_base + geom_area()
```
